# A clean react music player web application.

In this project I had designed the website on #Figma which is designer platform where users designs the web and mobile application interface.
After the design completed, I had to go for coding in react and implementing the logic for music statements for the application. You can click on the play, previous and next button for manipulating with the songs and on the right side is for playlist songs which is responsive with the according running with the current song.

## Test it out yourself!

Clone the repository and start testing out the application yourself!

In the project directory, you can run:

```
// 1. Install the dependencies:
npm install

// 3. Kick start the project in development mode:
npm run start
```

If you're ready to deploy the application to the internet, use:

```
npm run build
```

This will build the app for production to the "build" folder. The Built version will be optimized for best performance.
